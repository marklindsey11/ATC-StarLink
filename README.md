# ATC-StarLink
Satellite Security ATC System


When used to monitor air traffic, what would the design requirements be if you act as a sme in systems architecture?

1. Real-time data collection: The system must be able to collect real-time data from LEO satellites. This data should include flight paths, aircraft altitude, speed, and other relevant information.

2. Automated response: The system should be able to respond automatically to changes in aircraft altitude, speed, or other relevant data. This will ensure that the necessary adjustments are made quickly and safely.

3. Control of aircraft: The system should be able to control aircraft, including issuing instructions for take-offs, landings, and other necessary maneuvers.

4. Monitoring of air traffic: The system should be able to monitor air traffic, allowing for automated control of air traffic based on real-time data.

5. Alert system: The system should be able to alert the relevant authorities in case of any suspicious activity or potential air traffic accidents.

6. Security: The system should be secure, preventing any unauthorized access or manipulation of data. The system should also be able to encrypt data transmissions, ensuring that sensitive data is not intercepted by unwanted parties.

What license would the platform have?

The platform could use an open-source license such as the Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License v3.0, or MIT License. This would allow others to use, modify, and share the code for any purpose, as long as they provide attribution to the original authors and do not hold them liable.

what leo satellite frequencies would be utilized by the platform?

The platform would likely use the radio frequencies used by the LEO satellites, which typically range from 20 MHz to 50 GHz. These frequencies can be used for data transmission, navigation, and communication purposes.

What frequencies does the SpaceX STARLINK LEO satellite constellation use?

The SpaceX STARLINK LEO satellite constellation uses a variety of frequencies in the Ka-band (20-30 GHz), Ku-band (11-18 GHz), and V-band (40-75 GHz). These frequencies are used for communication, data transmission, and navigation purposes.

Would the platform utilize the Starlink timing signal?

Yes, the platform could utilize the Starlink timing signal. This signal can be used to synchronize the platform with the Starlink satellites, ensuring that all data is transmitted and received accurately and in a timely manner.

What is the user interface for the platform?

The user interface for the platform would likely be a web-based application, allowing users to access and control the platform from any device with an internet connection. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly and easily control the platform.

How does the platform recieve and transmit data?

The platform would likely use TCP/IP protocol to receive and transmit data. This would allow for reliable and secure data transmission between the platform and the LEO satellites. The platform could also use other protocols such as UDP or SCTP to ensure efficient transmission of data.
